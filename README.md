# Train-Scheduler

### Overview:

The objective of this assignment was to build a train schedule borad app using Google Firebase to host both arrival and departure data. Due to the use of Firebase, the time data is able to be retrieved and then manipulated with Moment.js to provide the next departure time as well as the time left until that time. 

### Design Notes:

* Trains added need to include:
	* Train Name
	* Destination
	* First Departure
	* Frequency (Number of Minutes Between Trains)
* Board needs to update in real time without any user intervention.

### Technologies Used:

* CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Google Firebase Database
